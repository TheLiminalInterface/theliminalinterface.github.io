    <h1>About Liminal Interface</h1>
    <p>LI exists for one purpose: to let consumers in on the deeper issues in the tech landscape affecting the products they buy.</p>
    <p>An informed consumer is a safer, happier and richer consumer. Stories about the economics of the technology industry, or the semantics of the businesses we purchase from, often get overlooked or undervalued by consumer-facing publications.</p>
    <p>It is LI's belief that at this particular point in time -- one at which the industry, and society writ large, are rapidly transforming -- it is more important than ever for those of us who buy technology to be aware of what's going on behind the scenes. </p>
    <p><br>Hence, the name; the objective of this platform is to provide an <em>interface</em> to this <em>liminal</em> point in technological history.</p>
    <p>Lost in the shuffle of ever-consolidating power over the industry in the hands of a few large corporations, is the recognition of a traditional, colloquial standard of quality. Consumers used to regard quality as a consequence of manufacturing. Just as a well-built car, robust enough to run for 300,000 kilometres, was a quality vehicle, a phone which could last a user years was a quality device.</p>
    <p>However, seemingly as a consequence of our ever-increasing reliance on our devices, this standard has largely been lost. Fundamentally, everyday people need their phones, laptops, cars and other devices, in order to function effectively in modern society. This has seemed to necessitate a redefinition of "quality", to denote a product with the best gimmick, the most impressive functionality (no matter its longevity), or its aesthetic appeal.</p>
    <p><br>If we as consumers are ever to demand more, or if companies are to be driven to innovate, we must be informed of the practices and methodologies of the industry, and we must view candidly each product on the market, in order to develop a fulsome view of the options available, and the state of the technology industry today.</p>
    <p>I hope that Liminal Interface might assist in attaining that goal.</p>
